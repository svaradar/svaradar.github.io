        <p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I worked on Powerbuilder (PB) for a while, went away and finally came back to using it. I came  in contact with Powerbuilder in the early 1990. I was working for a Consulting company and we evaluated several products to port an existing applications written in B-Trieve/C and some others in d-Base.</p>
<p>The version I came to see was ver 3.0 and it really took me by surprise. In those days, writing windows programs was not easy. Anyone written programs in C/C++ programs would understand. I also dabbled in a few tools, including C and Turbo Pascal. Remember all those resource files you had to do, to make a screen? PB (and few other tools of the day) changed all that. It was called the 4GL (4th generation language, as against C which was a 3GL language). These were the times when CASE tools were also becoming popular. See this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language">wiki article </a>for more on those.</p>
<p>So, PB naturally had a lot of competition. Microsoft Visual Basic, Gupta SQL, Oracle forms for windows (CDE) were there to name a few. We did try each of these, but PB fared better than the rest. (Of course Oracle forms was there already, which was popular and did the job, but it wasn’t a windows application builder. It’s cousin Oracle CDE didn’t do a good job at the time). Powerbuilder had something unique that made it win that round of the competition, the datawindows.</p>
<p>I joined one of the medium sized consulting companies in 1994. They got me into a shipping company, APL, in Oakland, CA. The company was porting their mainframe programs to client server world using Powerbuilder/Oracle. It was an ambitious plan, but it definitely looked glamorous (Kind of what mobile apps are to the current generation). With only some exposure to the product, I joined APL as a PB expert. All those mainframe programmers felt threatened and wanted to learn PB from me as quickly as possible to keep their jobs! Legacy has to go and the glitter of client/server was in! I saw several legacy products getting migrated from mainframe and other platforms to PB. There were products to bring mainframe data into PB screens including a “screen scraper” from Mitem View!</p>
<p>At that time Powerbuilder was owned by a company called Powersoft. It was a cute Client/Server product that allowed one to create windows screens that would connect to a database server and these were to replace those complex mainframe applications. It was like gold rush! For over 5 years, PB was ruling the corporate world. And like the gold rush came the bust as well.</p>
<p>The year was 1999. Sybase acquired PB by then. By then PB projects were dwindling down, and PB links on the web started disappearing on the web.  Java was in, at several of those places that went into PB earlier. Client/Server was not going to cut it any more and n-tier was the word. They did come up several contraptions to put themselves in the n-tier world, but none really succeeded back then.</p>
<p>I was in Toronto, trying to win a PB project at the time. I did some prototypes, but the local Sybase developers undercut us. They came with the just released PB 7.0, which we hadn’t seen. Their prototype and PB, both included a Treeview structure (sorta what you see in windows explorer). That was end of PB career, or so I thought at the time. I left the PB scene like 1000s of other programmers seeking greener pastures. Java came to the rescue, I also had an opportunity to get to know a great product called Forte. (Forte was a truly OO and n-tier product from the get go. More about it in another post).</p>
<p>Then, came recessions, job losses. In 2004, surprisingly, PB came to my rescue in an unsuspecting place in Fremont, CA. That kept me going a bit more and I branched into Oracle world. And another recession brought me back to the PB world again.</p>
<p>I recently took a job at the city of LA, in supporting and enhancing their Powerbuilder application running against EA Server.</p>
<p>In the world of short lived technologies and dying programming tools, I am amazed to find this product not only surviving, but evolving into what it is today, Powerbuilder + EA Server (Jaguar). In the upcoming posts, I will share some of my experiences and views about the tool!</p>

        <p>I am a born again Powerbuilder (developer)! That’s right I program in Sybase’s Powerbuilder, again!</p>
<p>Like many I also left it sometime in 1999 when it looked like fading. But, Powerbuilder has proved it’s worth and reserved it’s place and pace in the ever growing world of Java, C++ and .Net. It has not only survived the onslaught of new technologies, but I feel it is coming out of hibernation.</p>
<p>To those who don’t have a clue as to what Powerbuilder is, it’s a client server development tool that a small company called Powersoft brought out in the late 80’s. It had it’s hay days in the 90’s during the hysteria in corporate world to migrate out of “legacy” mainframe applications to Client/Server. Few of us, that knew Powerbuilder were the “new kids on the block” and the new order priests. But it all dried down soon after Sybase took over. By then internet programming took over and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Now, Powerbuilder is becoming “legacy” application itself and I know what those Mainframe programmers must have felt when we “Client/Server” programmers arrived. One consolation: Powerbuilder did not die while competition like Visual Basic, Gupta SQL and Oracle CDE slowly disappeared in the corporate scene, either naturally or because of company policies. At least, it has been a recession proof job finder for me.</p>
<p>If anyone tries to search “Powerbuilder” on the net, they may be up against broken links and/or old contents. There hasn’t been any good books written on the subject and while it seems to be dying, you also hear about Sybase bringing out the Powerbuilder ver 12.x and Pocketbuilder etc. They also silently integrated Java into their product line.</p>
<p>I recently took up yet another Powerbuilder job maintaining a PB 10.x application using EA Server 5.5. I intend to share with you my experiences and my love-hate relationship with the product.</p>
<p>Hope you find this useful.</p>

I am a Software developer by trade interested in all topics involving computers.</p>
<p>The title of the blog relates to Powerbuilder, an IDE that I have used to develop applications for several years.  But, the blog will also cover any software I use or build. I’ve been developing software in various languages and platforms (starting with machine code in Intel 8085 microprocessor) over the last 20+ years. I intend to share my experiences,  tips &amp; tricks and general programming concepts here. I hope to make it worth the visitor’s time here.</p>
<p>The title also relates to the power in building beautiful Software. Building? Software industry has borrowed several terms from other fields. We “build” software using nice design and architecture and we use other programs called “tools” in building it. And we call ourselves, “Software Engineers” and Designers and Architects.</p>
<p>To me, a programmer is not unlike an author writing a book or an artist painting a picture or an architect finishing a beautiful building. A program is not only powerful but also beautiful like a building or a painting! I do get a sense of beauty in mind, when a software is done right! Even the means of arriving at the solution (Abstraction of problems) is “beautiful”.</p>
<p>Thank you again for stopping by!</p>

        <p>My neighbor brought his computer to me about a month ago! First, I thought it was just the video card. So, I bought one through e-bay. Nop. Then I am on to CPU. I refuse to accept it may be the motherboard! This particular model doesn’t have a model #. Only a serial #. Compaq/HP online support was so good. He was able to find out the details of the machine. From there I learned more and more about it.<br>I gathered it was 1.1 GHz celeron processor. So, I set out to work. I ordered, again on ebay, a CPU that looked similar. Least I knew, <strong>not</strong> all 1.1 GHZ celeron processors were the same. They looked the same (green top and all), but since I had not looked into the CPU before, I assumed all were alike.</p>
<p>The new CPU arrived last week. I finally removed the clip on the heat sink. This was interesting. I hit the mother board a few times with the screwdriver. I hope I didn’t damage it. The clip was to be pushed down and twisted to pull it out the plastic tab holding it.</p>
<p>So, I set out to go Fry’s electronics yesterday. I bought a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anti static arm band</li>
<li>Antistatic gloves</li>
<li>thermal grease remover, cleaner</li>
<li>thermal paste, anatec  silver</li>
</ol>
<p>This is becoming an expensive affair.</p>
<p>The following websites were really useful in finding out more about celeron cpu’s in general and about removing/replacing cpu/heat sink or fan.</p>
<p>Celeron models: There are differences!!!<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/187/6">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/187/6</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.intel.com/support/processors/pentiumiii/sb/CS-007568.htm">http://www.intel.com/support/processors/pentiumiii/sb/CS-007568.htm</a></p>

<p>And there is even names for these Pentium 3/Celeron sockets:<br>coppermine (PGA ) and Tualatin (PGA2)<br>There is even a socket to put the new chip in the old socket!!</p>

        <p>Today in a meeting they were discussing differences between Oracle and Sybase. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">1. Values Larger than Column</span><br /><br />While inserting a value into a string column, Sybase truncates the value to the length of the database column. Oracle on the other hand, doesn’t do such a thing. (To me this sounds like the proper behavior, but then again I’ve been working with Oracle too long). If you insert a value that’s longer than the column, then it will throw the following exception: <br /><br />9i above below: <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">ORA-01401: inserted value too large for column<br /></span></span><br />Oracle 10g: <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">ORA-12899: value too large for column “SCOTT”.”EMP”.”ENAME” (actual: 12, maximum: 10)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"></span></span><br /></span><br /><br />Example:<br /><br />create table t1(code varchar2(4));<br /><br />insert into t1 values (‘TEST’);<br /><br />insert into foo values (‘ATOMS’); &lt;– Generates the above exception in Oracle, whereas in Sybase this will be inserted as ATOM. (or so I was told)<br /><br />Note: In Sybase this behavior can be mimicked by using<br /><span style="font-style:italic;"> set string_rtruncation on<br /></span><br />The default setting is off. To mimic Sybase behavior in Oracle use the substr function to get the right size of the value.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Case sensitivity in WHERE conditions<br /></span><br /><br />Oracle comparisons are case sensitive. Depending on the case of the text and how it was input, we may have to bring both sides of = sign to the same case before comparing.<br /><br />Sybase ignores the case of the actual text while comparing.<br /><br /><br />Example:<br /><br />INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(‘test’);<br /><br />In Sybase the following SQLs return 1 Row.<br /><br /><br />SELECT FROM t1 WHERE code = ‘TEST’;<br /><br />SELECT FROM t1 WHERE code = ‘TeSt’;<br /><br />In Oracle both the above SQLs will not return any row.<br /><br />Note: To mimic Oracle behavior in Sybase, the sorting order needs to be changed. This is done at the server level using utilities like sqlloc. To mimic Sybase behavior use lower or upper function on either side of the equal sign.</p>

        <p>I have been working with various databases in different settings. Client Server, backend programming etc. Few times I have even worked in upgrading versions of databases. Though I have had interludes with many different databases including informix, DB2 and esoteric Integra SQL, I’ve been mostly working with Oracle databases for most part. From Oracle version 6 to Oracle 10g recently. I’ve seen the database mature so much. In fact, when I got back to Oracle after a little break, I kept coding in old style not using newer features. Only recently when I took up a job to do a conversion of database from Sybase to Oracle, I started realizing the how much Oracle had changed and all the new features in it.</p>
<p>When I did client server programming in PB, C or Java, I didn’t have to explore all the features in the database. But when I had to see the insides of the programs in Sybase and try to convert to Oracle the best possible ways, the door opened up. Entire book of Oracle is wide open now and suddenly I am conscious about every little feature or deficiency in Oracle.</p>
